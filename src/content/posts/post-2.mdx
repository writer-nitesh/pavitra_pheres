Marriage, a sacred bond celebrated as a union of two souls, is adorned with rituals and traditions that vary across cultures and regions. In the mystical land of Uttarakhand, also known as "DEV BHOOMI" or the "Land Of God," weddings are not just ceremonies; they are cultural extravaganzas filled with timeless rituals that reflect the rich heritage of the region.

### Sagai/Engagement



The journey of a Pahadi wedding begins with the Sagai, a pre-wedding ceremony where the families exchange rings, symbolizing the formal announcement of the union. Unlike conventional engagements, in Pahadi tradition, it's the fathers of the couple who exchange rings, marking the beginning of the wedding festivities.

### Ganesh Puja

Every auspicious occasion in Hindu culture commences with the blessings of Lord Ganesha. In Uttarakhand weddings, the Ganesh Puja is a reverent ritual performed to seek the deity's blessings for a harmonious and prosperous married life.

### Tehri Nath

A significant adornment in Pahadi weddings is the Tehri Nath, a magnificent nose ring made of gold or pearls. Symbolizing marital status, this adornment is bestowed upon the bride either by the groom's family or her maternal uncle, adding a touch of grace and tradition to her bridal attire.

### Rangwali Pichora

The Rangwali Pichora, a vibrant and symbolic veil worn by married women during ceremonies, is a hallmark of Uttarakhand weddings. Adorned with intricate designs and embellishments, this saffron-hued veil holds cultural significance and adds elegance to the bridal ensemble.

### Suwal Pithai

Unique to Uttarakhand weddings is the Suwal Pithai, a ritual where dough is prepared, dried in sunlight, and fried to make chapattis. These chapattis, offered as Prashad to the gods and shared with guests, are accompanied by traditional Mangal Geet sung by the women, infusing the ceremony with joyous melodies.

### Duliargh

As the groom's procession, or Baraat, arrives at the wedding venue, it is greeted with warmth and hospitality by the bride's family in a ceremony known as Duliargh. Amidst the exchange of garlands and rose petals, the groom is revered as Lord Vishnu, and blessings are bestowed upon him by the bride's parents.

### Vidaai

The Vidaai marks the poignant moment of departure as the bride bids farewell to her parental home and embarks on a new journey with her partner. As she tosses rice and coins over her head, symbolizing prosperity for her natal home, emotions run high, encapsulating both joy and sorrow.

### Conclusion

Uttarakhand weddings are a celebration of love, tradition, and togetherness, where each ritual is imbued with cultural significance and spiritual fervor. From the solemnity of Ganesh Puja to the emotional Vidaai, every moment is etched with memories that resonate through generations, making Uttarakhand weddings truly unforgettable.
